                Government of National Unity, expedite the necessary preparatory planning for
                transition of AMIS to a United Nations operation, including options for how
                UNMIS can reinforce the effort for peace in Darfur through additional appropriate
                transitional assistance to AMIS, including assistance in logistics, mobility and
                communications, and that the Secretary-General present to the Council by 24 April

                Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), which continue to attack civilians and commit
                human rights abuses in the Sudan; and urges in this regard UNMIS to make full use
                of its current mandate and capabilities;

                make recommendations to the Council; and looks forward to receiving by 24 April
                2006 these recommendations which would include proposals on how United Nations
                agencies and missions, in particular UNMIS, could more effectively address the
                problem of the LRA;
                       9.   Encourages the Sudanese parties to finalize the establishment of national
                institutions for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants
                (DDR), as stipulated in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and to expedite the
